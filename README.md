# source-classification
classifying sources in seismic data using machine learning 
uses Scattering Transform package by Joan Bruna and Stephane Mallat
  http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2012/06/new-implementations-of-mallats.html
and K-Wave for wave propagation
  http://www.k-wave.org/
  
To begin, run main.m to generate training/test data from wave propagation
then run generic_classifier.m to perform machine learning.

You will need to add the path for both the k-wave and scattering transform packages.
